# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
puts house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
# YOUR CODE HERE

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
puts "#{students + 2}"


# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
puts "#{students - 2}"


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Cole"
is_hungry = " is hungry"
number_of_pets = 0
puts first_name + is_hungry
puts first_name + " has #{number_of_pets} pets"
# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
#First_name would be a single word string since they are not asking for the full name.
#Is_hungry could be used as a repeatable phrase which is why it's assigned as a variable
#but is already pretty well defined so I just assigned it as a "phrase string" to make
#longer sentences
#Number_of_pets is requesting a number just like in it's name, and since I don't currently
#have any pets, I assigned it to 0.
# Explain.


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.


# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

puts "#{healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks}"
#-------------------
# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
#heck yes I did! It works!
