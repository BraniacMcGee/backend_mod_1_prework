## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
SMART Goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant) and mistakes are critical to learning

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I could likely do a better job on setting SMART goals as opposed to just shooting for the moon, but I do feel myself getting better at treating mistakes as a learning experience as opposed to outright failure.
1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
An array is an ordered list of objects, a Hash is a list associating pairs of things
1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet_store = {'dog_food_bags' => 500, 'fish_tanks' => 40, turtles => 15}
1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
puts states[IA]
1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
states.keys / states.values
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
If we were writing out coordinates to find buried treasure. An array may have an order, but with a hash you can assign paired values to latitude, longitude, elevation, etc
1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
Why do they make my brain hurt? :(
